# WinLib

An open source library that allows easy creation and customization of a gui!

## Usage
Using it is very simple and allows for easy manipulation of the gui.

```lua
local winLib = loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HappySunChild/Window-Library/main/Library.lua", true))
-- from here you can do;

local window = winLib.new([[window title here]])
```
